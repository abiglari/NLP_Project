   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [EXCERPTS]
THE EXTRADITABLES TODAY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF
ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, WHICH
OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN MEDELLIN.  THE CRIMINAL ATTACK ON THE OFFICER
OCCURED A SCANT 1 MONTH AFTER THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT
GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR.

   A POLICEMAN WAS KILLED AND ANOTHER POLICEMAN WOUNDED DURING THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.  COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT BY HIS
OWN BEHEST.  COL QUINTERO WAS DIRECTING OPERATIONS AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF DEATH THREATS.
HERE IS A REPORT BY GLADYS VARGAS FROM MEDELLIN.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] THIS MORNING ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO LEFT HIS RESIDENCE TO BEGIN HIS DAILY
TASKS AT ANTIOQUIA POLICE HEADQUARTERS.  AS THE VEHICLE DROVE THROUGH
THE AMERICA NEIGHBORHOOD, SEVEN BLOCKS FROM WHERE ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR
ANTONIO ROLDAN WAS KILLED, THE VEHICLE THAT COL QUINTERO WAS IN -- A
WHITE NISSAN PATROL VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATES ME-7847 -- DREW TO A
STOP IN FRONT OF A RED LIGHT AT THE CARRERA 80 CROSSING.  SEVERAL
INDIVIDUALS IN A GRAY MAZDA 626 VEHICLE, WITH LICENSE PLATES MI-1630,
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO FIRE VOLLEYS OF SUBMACHINEGUN
FIRE AGAINST COL QUINTERO, WHO DIED INSTANTLY.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT.  JUST 8 DAYS AGO HE
DECIDED TO DISMISS THE ESCORT, BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO
BE KILLED IF THERE WERE AN ATTACK ON HIM.  ONLY COL QUINTERO AND A
POLICE DRIVER WERE IN THE VEHICLE.

   THE JUDGE OF THE 76TH DISTRICT COURT, WHO DIRECTED THE REMOVAL OF
THE BODY, SAID THAT SEVERAL TYPES OF WEAPONS WERE USED IN THE ATTACK
AND MORE THAN 100 SHOTS WERE FIRED. [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 MAY 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] TO DATE, THE
ARMY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF A REPORT THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT HAS
SAID IT SENT TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT IN THAT COUNTRY CONCERNING THE DEATH OF SALVADORAN LEFTIST
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES.

   OQUELI, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) AND
HILDA FLORES, A GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER WERE ABDUCTED AND
KILLED IN JANUARY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN GUATEMALA CITY AS
THEY WERE HEADING TO THE LA AURORA AIRPORT.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO WAS IN CARACAS ON THE OCCASION OF THE MEETING
BETWEEN THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT -
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] AND A DELEGATION OF THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT.  ON THAT OCCASION PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH BOTH
DELEGATIONS SEPARATELY.  HE INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS
BEING CONDUCTED CONCERNING THE CRIME AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WOULD SEND
HIS GOVERNMENT'S VERSION TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.

   SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT "SALVADORAN RIGHTIST
SECTORS AND SOLDIERS" COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME, YESTERDAY ARMY
SPOKESMEN WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT.  THEY SAID THAT
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HEARD SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, THEY HAVE NO
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE REPORT, WHICH THEY EXPECT TO SEE SOON, IF
IT IS NOT JUST SPECULATION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JAN 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT]
[MAURICIO FUNES] [TEXT] AFTER NEARLY A 2-MONTH ABSENCE FROM THE
NATIONAL PRESS, MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HOLDS THE VIEW THAT THE
ARMED FORCES SHOULD NOT BE CRITICIZED FOR THE ISOLATED BEHAVIOR OF
SOME OF ITS MEMBERS.  THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
LEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE
ONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS' MURDER CASE COULD BE
CLEARED-UP.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION [ARMED
FORCES] THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.  REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS
MEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR
POLITICAL REASONS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE
ARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT
OUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS.  IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE
PASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN
ON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD
TO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE
HAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. [END RECORDING]

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN
CLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE
CONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] THE JESUITS' CASE WAS A DETERMINING
FACTOR.  BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF
THE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS
IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS.  I DO NOT
BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID
ARISE [WHEREBY AID WAS SUSPENDED], THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN.  I
KNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE
DISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS.
FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE
NEIGHBORHOODS.  WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY
CAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM
OF CIVILIANS WOUNDED.  FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE
THINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE
THEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. [END RECORDING]

   THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS
AGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE
MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN
THE PARTY.  D'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] NOT IN THE LEAST.  THERE HAVE NEVER
BEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE
ARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE
MAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING.  THIS IS REASON FOR
PRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTY
AND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]

   IN COMMENTING ON THE DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, D'AUBUISSON SUPPORTED
PRESIDENT CRITIANI'S INITIATIVE OF ENGAGING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] I DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE TIME TO
ACT AS MEDIATOR; HOWEVER, HE COULD ACT AS A GUARANTOR, RECEIVING
RESULTS OF THESE TALKS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS
MADE. [END RECORDING]

   MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, CURRENTLY AN ARENA DEPUTY, SAID THAT THIS
YEAR HE WILL DEDICATE HIS TIME TO EXPAND AND REORGANIZE THE PARTY TO
GET READY FOR THE 1991 MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE WILL
MOST LIKELY NOT BE AN ARENA DEPUTY IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PERIOD,
BECAUSE HE, ALONG WITH OTHER FORMER LEGISLATORS, WILL CONCENTRATE
THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT.

   BOGOTA, 1 FEB 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION
(ELN) HAS ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR,
GOVERNOR OF THE NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THAT IT REJECTS THE
PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ARMED
ATTACKS, IT WAS LEARNED A FEW HOURS AGO.

   ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE ARMED MOVEMENT--THE MOST RADICAL
OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY--SENT THE MESSAGE THROUGH LUIS
MESA PUERTA, A POLICE INSPECTOR OF EL TIGRE, WHO WAS KIDNAPED LAST
FRIDAY FOR THIS PURPOSE.

   ROLDAN BETANCUR DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY MORE DETAILS AND MERELY
CONFIRMED THAT THE CASTROITE ELN, WHICH HAS STAGED SEVERAL DYNAMITE
ATTACKS AGAINST OIL INSTALLATIONS, DID NOT ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL MADE BY
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS' GOVERNMENT.

   MEANWHILE, THE M-19 SENT A LETTER A FEW HOURS AGO TO MISAEL
PASTRANA BORRERO, A FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PSC), REQUESTING THAT HIS PARTY ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATE IN A NEW PEACE INITIATIVE THAT FORMALLY BEGAN THE 2D WEEK
OF JANUARY.

   AT THAT TIME, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA--THE
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE--AND THE TOP M-19 COMMANDER, CARLOS
PIZARRO LEON GOMEZ, SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THAT CONTEMPLATES
THE BEGINNING OF A DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLA GROUPS AND
SPOKESMEN OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT.

   HOWEVER, THE FARC, WHICH DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE TO FACILIATE
THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATIONS, SAID THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WERE
"EXCLUSIVE," AS THEY WERE SIGNED BY ONLY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REBEL
MOVEMENTS.

   THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SPECIFIES THAT
THE TASKS WITH ALL THE REBEL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE
SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNGSB).  HOWEVER,
WITH THE ELN ANNOUNCEMENT, A JOINT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RULED OUT.

   MEANWHILE, PRIOR TO LEAVING TODAY FOR CARACAS WHERE HE WILL ATTEND
THE INAUGURATION OF CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, THE PRESIDENT HELD A MEETING
WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES, FORMER PRESIDENTS
JULIO CESAR TURBAY OF THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, AND PASTRANA BORRERO,
OF THE PSC.

   THE MEETING HELD AT THE NARINO PALACE (SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT) WAS
CALLED SO THAT BARCO VARGAS COULD REPORT TO THE PSC ON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE MOST RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE NEW PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN
WITH THE M-19.

   ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL CIRCLES, IN THIS MANNER THE PATH TOWARD
PEACE MIGHT BE CLEARED, INASMUCH AS ONE OF THE "RESERVATIONS" THE PSC
HAD WAS THAT THE BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE
PARTIES ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.

   MADRID (SPAIN), 19 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE BODIES
OF THE SPANISH JESUITS MURDERED LAST FRIDAY [17 NOVEMBER] BY UNIFORMED
INDIVIDUALS WERE BURIED IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT
HAS ASKED THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FOR EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THESE
DEATHS.  TODAY IN PARIS THE SPANISH PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT FUTURE
CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI DEPENDS ON THE
RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EFFORT SHOULD BE
MADE IMMEDIATELY TO INVESTIGATE WHAT HAPPENED REGARDING MURDERS WHICH
SOME PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY INTERPRETING IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT
THEY ARE SPANISH, OR SPANISH CITIZENS WHO TOOK ON SALVADORAN
CITIZENSHIP, BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE CITIZENS WHO
SUFFERED THIS APPALLING ATTACK, THIS MURDER, WERE SPANISH.  OUR
CONCERN OBVIOUSLY IS NOT EXPRESSED MERELY IN TERMS OF THIS OR THAT
NATIONALITY BECAUSE THIS MURDER IS A HIDEOUS CRIME AND THUS THE MATTER
MUST BE CLEARED UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND FURTHERMORE MUCH OF THE
EFFORT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] WITH REGARD
TO THAT COUNTRY DEPENDS UPON IT.  [END RECORDING]

   A SPANISH DIPLOMATIC DELEGATION HEADED BY UNDERSECRETARY FOR
FOREIGN AFFAIRS INOCENCIO ARIAS ATTENDED THE BURIAL OF THE JESUITS.
HE PUT HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SPANISH RESIDENTS IN EL SALVADOR
WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND RETURN TO SPAIN.

   SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] A BOMB WENT OFF THIS
MORNING NEAR A POWER TOWER IN SAN SALVADOR LEAVING A LARGE PART OF THE
CITY WITHOUT ENERGY, BUT NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL SOURCES, THE BOMB -- ALLEGEDLY DETONATED BY
URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS -- BLEW UP A POWER TOWER IN THE NORTHWESTERN
PART OF SAN SALVADOR AT 0650 (1250 GMT).

(FMLN) DECREED A SUSPENSION OF ITS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AND OF ITS SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST MEANS OF
TRANSPORTATION, BUSINESSES, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

   THAT DECISION, AIMED AT CREATING THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A
NEW ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ENERGY

A PLURALIST GOVERNMENT WHICH INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE
PATRIOTIC GROUPS OF THE NATION.  LET US SAVE OUR CAPITAL, WHICH IS
BEING BOMBED DUE TO A FOREIGN MENTALITY.  IT IS BEING BOMBED AND
DESTROYED BY AN OCCUPATION ARMY.  THE AIRPLANES ARE NOW BEING FLOWN BY
U.S. PILOTS AT NIGHT, AND THEY HAVE THE MENTALITY OF AN OCCUPATION
ARMY.

   SALVADORANS, LET US UNITE AND ORGANIZE OURSELVES.  LET US NOT
REMAIN IDLE.  WE MUST MOBILIZE OURSELVES RIGHT NOW AND ORGANIZE A
COMMITTEE IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  THE
PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE.  THE FMLN HAS BEGUN ITS 7TH DAY IN THE CAPITAL,
AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE ARE ADVANCING TOWARD VICTORY.  VICTORY WILL BE
OURS AND COLONEL PONCE HAS GIVEN PROOF OF HIS DESPERATION WITH THE
JESUIT PRIESTS' ASSASSINATION IN SAN SALVADOR.  HE HAS OVERSTEPPED HIS
MARK AND THE PEOPLE'S PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED.  WE URGE ALL OUR PEOPLE
TO JOIN THE GENERAL UPRISING, STRUGGLE, TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND ORGANIZE
EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO OUST THIS CORRUPT AND MURDEROUS REGIME.  WE
URGE THE PEOPLE TO MOBILIZE,TO TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND TO STAY IN THE
NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS TO STRUGGLE FOR THE LIBERATION OF
OUR HOMELAND.  WE MUST ACHIEVE PROGRESS.

   INFORMATION HAS JUST ARRIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES, INDICATING
THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO WITHDRAW ITS UNCONDITIONAL
SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR.  INFORMATION RECEIVED
FROM THE UNITED STATES INDICATES THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO
RECANT ITS IRRESPONSIBLE AND GENOCIDAL ATTITUDE OF SENDING U.S.
PILOTS TO BOMB OUR CAPITAL BY NIGHT.  THAT IS THE PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING THAT U.S. IMPERIALISM IS CURRENTLY GIVING THE ARMED FORCES,
MEANING TO BOMB THE CAPITAL BY NIGHT, AS ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL
HAVE WITNESSED IN RECENT HOURS.

   THUS, WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE: ORGANIZE YOURSELVES.  WE

   BUENOS AIRES, 13 DEC 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] LAST NIGHT, A FEW HOURS
BEFORE THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, A VIOLENT EXPLOSION DAMAGED
THE WINDOWS AND FACING OF THE SALVADORAN CONSULATE IN SANTIAGO.  NO
ONE WAS INJURED.

   A FLAG FROM THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) WAS FOUND
AT THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE FPMR IS A CLANDESTINE LEFTIST
GROUP THAT PROMOTES "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE" AGAINST THE MILITARY
GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET.

   POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED SERIOUS
DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY BUILDING AND TO NEARBY STRUCTURES IN
THE ELEGANT PROVIDENCIA NEIGHORHOOD IN EASTERN SANTIAGO.

   THE GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE FPMR, WHICH ON 14 DECEMBER WILL
MARK 6 YEARS OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, IS THE "ARMED BRANCH" OF THE
OUTLAWED COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.  AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THE
CARABINEROS AND POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS WERE CARRYING OUT
AN INTENSIVE OPERATION TO ARREST THOSE RESPONISBLE FOR THE ATTACK.

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [TEXT] TODAY
RESCUE TEAMS, ARMY TROOPS, AND POLICE HAD THE SORRY TASK OF RECOVERING
107 DISFIGURED BODIES OF THE VICTIMS OF AVIANCA'S BOEING 727 THAT
EXPLODED IN MIDAIR IN A SPARSELY POPULATED REGION NEAR BOGOTA.
ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE
THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM.  THE PLANE DEPARTED
BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT
DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR.  BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN
COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO
EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE
TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST
ACTION.  THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM
THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S.
FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION.
ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK
NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION
WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE.  THE
POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT
CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO
AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 18 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE
GUATEMALAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL MAKE THE
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AND THE GUATEMALAN ARMY "PAY
DEARLY" FOR HAVING "INTERVENED" IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

   A COMMUNIQUE BY THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG),
RELEASED IN COSTA RICA, STRESSED THAT 126 ELITE TROOPS OF THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY, KNOWN AS KAIBILES, ARE COLLABORATING WITH SALVADORAN
SOLDIERS TO PUT AN END TO THE OFFENSIVE BY GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).

   THE URNG CHARGE, ALSO PRESENTED BY THE FMLN, HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY
AND REPEATEDLY DENIED BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN CLAUDIA
ARENAS.

   THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATED: "WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE
INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY
FOR THIS AGGRESSION."

   THE NOTE WAS RELEASED SHORTLY AFTER SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THE VICTORY OF HIS COUNTRY'S ARMY OVER THE FMLN,
FOLLOWING FIERCE FIGHTING THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEAD AND MORE
THAN 1,500 WOUNDED IN THE PAST 7 DAYS.

   IN ADDITION, THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY "WITH
THE COMMUNITY OF JESUIT PRIESTS" AND THEIR SORROW BECAUSE OF THE
KILLING OF SIX OF THEIR MEMBERS, INCLUDING CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA AND TWO WOMEN, CARRIED OUT BY UNIFORMED MEN
IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   THE URNG DECLARATION IS SIGNED BY COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR

   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FRANCISCO
MERINO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND INTERIOR MINISTER, HAS
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO.  MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS
BEASTS.

   THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE
SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS
TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK.  GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE
GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE [COMISION DE APOYO
GUBERNAMENTAL DE DIALOGO], WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE
INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE
BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE
CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC.  I THINK
THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY
POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER
DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION.  THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON
ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS.  THEY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION.  THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS
AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF
THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED
AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED.  THIS
WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF
THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH
HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY.

   AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS
CASE.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A
FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS
HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO
THESE MURDERERS.  IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE
REGRETS LATER.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE
TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED.  CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL
AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN
PEOPLE WITH SORROW.

HAVE DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE MRS PATRICIA ECHAVARRIA AND HER
DAUGHTER AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE AS
CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT.  WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CASES OF KIDNAPPED PEOPLE OF WHICH WE ARE
ACCUSED.

   8.  WE OFFER OUR SERVICES AS MEDIATORS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITH THE
EMERALD TRAFFICKERS, THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS, AND THE
SO-CALLED HIRED ASSASSINS WITH THE ONLY PURPOSE OF ENDING THE VIOLENCE
THAT IS HURTING OUR COLOMBIAN FATHERLAND.

OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR ACTIVITIES AS SOON AS WE GET
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GUARANTEES.

AND WE HAVE ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL TYPES OF EXECUTIONS OF
POLITICAL LEADERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ASSOCIATION LEADERS, JUDICIAL
OFFICIALS, JOURNALISTS, POLICEMEN, AND SOLDIERS.

   11.  THE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR OUR STRUGGLE HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS
BE OUR FAMILIES, OUR FREEDOM, OUR PEOPLE, OUR LIVES, AND OUR RIGHTS AS
CITIZENS OF THIS FATHERLAND.

SOON HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THE DEATH OF
THIS CRIMINAL.

   IN AN INTERVIEW, GEN CASADIEGO TORRADO INFORMED RCN OF THE
OPERATION MOUNTED IN THE AREA WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CASADIEGO] WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THOSE
OPERATING IN THAT AREA THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND THE PEOPLE
WITH THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED.

   THAT IS THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AVAILABLE.  WE DO NOT HAVE DETAILS
ON THE OPERATION YET.  IT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG-TERM INTELLIGENCE
WORK CARRIED OUT WITH GREAT PROFESSIONALISM, WHICH GAVE US INFORMATION
ON WHERE HE COULD BE FOUND.  WE DEPLOYED SPECIAL GROUPS TO CARRY OUT
THAT TASK.

   [REPORTER] GENERAL, EXACTLY WHERE DID THE OPERATION, IN WHICH
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KILLED, TAKE PLACE?

   [CASADIEGO] IN A RURAL AREA, AS YOU KNOW, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF
THE COUNTRY.  I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT LOCATION.

   [REPORTER] HAS IT BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND
HIS SON WERE KILLED?  IS THIS AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL
POLICE?

   [CASADIEGO] THAT IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE.  THAT IS THE
INFORMATION I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT.

   [REPORTER] WHO ARE THE OTHER 15 PEOPLE KILLED?

   [CASADIEGO] WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THEM YET.  OFFICIALS ARE
TRAVELING TO THE SITE TO OFFICIALLY IDENTIFY THE BODIES.

   [REPORTER] WERE THEY ASSISTANTS, BODYGUARDS, ESCORTS?

   [CASADIEGO] YES, WE ARE SURE OF THAT.

   [REPORTER] HAVE WEAPONS OR OTHER ITEMS BEEN CONFISCATED?  WE HAVE
HEARD THAT IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND.

   [CASADIEGO] YES, WE KNOW THAT WEAPONS WERE FOUND WHICH WERE USED TO
PROTECT THIS MAN.  HOWEVER, AS I SAID, WE DO NOT HAVE THE DETAILS ON
THE INCIDENT YET.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS SON

   [REPORTER] WHO ELSE IS THERE?  IS THERE A COMMISSION OF JUDGES?  WE
UNDERSTAND THAT A FEW MOMENTS AGO A PLANE DEPARTED WITH
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE AND THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

   [CASADIEGO] I DO NOT KNOW IF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE HAVE TRAVELED THERE.  WE SENT POLICE

NEIGHBORHOOD.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI

NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD AND POWER LINES HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED.  AS A RESULT
OF THIS SABOTAGE, AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR DOES NOT HAVE POWER.  WE
HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT TWO TRANSFORMERS WERE DESTROYED ON KM 10 OF THE
NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD, WHERE BARRICADES WERE ALSO SET UP.  THE REPORT
ADDS THAT THE ENEMY SHOWED UP 90 MINUTES AFTER THE BARRICADES HAD BEEN
SET UP AND HEAVY FIGHTING RESULTED.  THE ENEMY TROOPS SUFFERED FOUR
