You can run this in 2 ways (different in running time, but the same result)
1) To run everything including the training of the classifiers (This takes about 3min):
   ./infoextract input-file-name
2) To run everything except training the classifiers (this uses my pre-trained classifiers and takes about 2min):
   ./infoextract_fast input-file-name
