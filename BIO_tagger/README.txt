You can run this in 2 ways (different in running time, but the same result)
1) To run everithing including the training of the classifiers with (This takes about 25min):
   ./infoextract input-file-name
2) To run everything except training the classifiers (this uses my pre-trained classifiers and takes about 4min):
   ./infoextract_fast input-file-name

1) Team member: Amir Biglari 
   This is all my individual work and I received minor help from the other team member. 
2) Teammember: Wei Zhao
   He did not have any contribution for this work. He was supposed to creat an IE program using case frames. 
   He just gave me a single python script (about 100 lines) at the day of submission and did not show up. I could not run his script
   and he was not there to explain. So, I had to stick with my approach and submit only my work!
